## UX

### Project Goals

Lockdown Kitchen is part of my Code Institute Full Stack Software Development studies, the Data Centric Development module.
The scope for this milestone project is to "Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes", using the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete for their recipes. 
My directive was to make an online cokctail app that users could find and share recipes, at the same time impoving their bussineses.
Inspire, entertain and educate anyone—and everyone—interested in what happens in the glass.

### User Stories

- [x] easily acces cocktail recipes from different kind of devices.
- [x] all recipes in one place.
- [x] find cocktails by spirits.
- [x] find cocktails by ingredients I have at home.
- [x] share cocktails by adding them to database.
- [x] edit existing cocktails when I find a mistake or I have a better version of the recipe.
- [x] delete recipes.
- [x] send a feedback to the developer.
- [x] get success or error message to know my feedback was successfully submitted.

### Developer Goals

- Provide a nice, easy to use online cocktail book where the user can create, edit, delete recipes, and filter them by categories and ingredients.
- Learn by practice about databases, Jinja templating, Materialize, and how to use Python with JavaScript.
- Get an insight into Heroku's platform.

### Design

To make an integrated design for this site I used Materialize Icons and Materializecss. 
The cards with borders, the logo with forms. The best-used components are cards. I choosed cards as container of the infos, recipes, and detailed descriptions because the structure of a card helps me to organize the information in a user-friendly way.
For providing feedback and adding recipe I used forms with simply put placeholders.

### Color Scheme

The Colour scheme has modern colours. The supplementary colours are a mix of colours (white,grey,red) used in the cards that is throughout and at the Delete button I set red background color. It contrasts nicely with the text.  The two most important colors are dark blue and the "brick brown"used for the Header/Navigation/Footer and the Feedback form.

### Fonts

The font I selected to this page is Arvo and Playfair from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) because it fits perfectly to playful and clear-out theme of the site.
